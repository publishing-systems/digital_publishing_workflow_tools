messageArgumentsMissingUsage = Usage:
messageParameterList = job-file result-info-file
messageResultInfoFileCantGetCanonicalPath = Can''t get canonical path of result information file "{0}".
messageResultInfoPathIsADirectory = Result information path "{0}" is a directory.
messageResultInfoFileIsntWritable = Result information file "{0}" isn''t writable.
messageJobFileCantGetCanonicalPath = Can''t get canonical path of the job file "{0}".
messageJobFileDoesntExist = Job file "{0}" doesn''t exist.
messageJobPathIsntAFile = Job path "{0}" isn''t a file.
messageJobFileIsntReadable = Job file "{0}" isn''t readable.
messageCallDetails = Called with job file "{0}" and result information file "{1}".
messageJobFileEntryIsMissingAnAttribute = Entry #{1} in job file "{0}" is missing its "{2}" attribute.
messageJobFileEntryInputFileDoesntExist = The input file "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) doesn''t exist.
messageJobFileEntryInputPathIsntAFile = Input path "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) isn''t a file.
messageJobFileEntryInputFileIsntReadable = Input file "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) isn''t readable.
messageJobFileEntryEntitiesResolverConfigFileDoesntExist = Entities resolver configuration file "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) doesn''t exist.
messageJobFileEntryEntitiesResolverConfigPathIsntAFile = Entities resolver configuration path "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) isn''t a file.
messageJobFileEntryEntitiesResolverConfigFileIsntReadable = Entities resolver configuration file "{2}" (configured in job file "{0}", entry #{1}) isn''t readable.

messageJobFileErrorWhileReading = An error occurred while reading job file "{0}".
messageJobFileNoEntriesConfigured = No entries configured in job file "{0}".
messageCantUseEntityResolver2 = Your JavaVM doesn''t support EntityResolver2, therefore some external DTDs might not be identified by a path relative to their parent DTD, but by an absolute path instead. If this is the case, you could at least put absolute paths into the entities resolver configuration file "{0}".
messageNoEntityResolver = Running without entity resolver. This should never happen, at least an empty entities resolver configuration file should have been specified.
messageErrorWhileTransforming = An error occurred while transforming entry #{1} of job file "{0}".
